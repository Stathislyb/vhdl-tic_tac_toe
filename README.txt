The game's mechanics were developed in an FPGA using VHDL. 
As inputs we used the FPGA's switches and as output an LCD monitor at 640x480 resolution.
Two options were available for the gameplay having the ability to play against an AI or against an other player. 
Proper checks were used to ensure that the game's rules were not broken by either the AI or the players and that the correct winner was announced or a message for draw in case of such result.

This was a semester project for the class Digital Design 2, supervised by Dr. Giorgos Dimitrakopoulos.
